# Duplicate Message Fix

## Problem
Ray responses were appearing twice in the chat interface because there were duplicate `postMessage` calls in the extension code.

## Root Cause
In `src/extension.ts`, the `handleRayPostResponse` function was sending **two separate messages** to the webview:

1. First message: `addMessage` command format
2. Second message: `rayResponse` type format (sent after 50ms delay)

This caused the JavaScript in the webview to process both messages and display the same content twice.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Extension Code (`src/extension.ts`)
- **Removed duplicate postMessage calls**
- **Kept only the `rayResponse` format** which is properly handled by the webview
- **Eliminated the 50ms delay** that was causing timing issues

**Before:**
```typescript
// Two separate postMessage calls
currentPanel.webview.postMessage(commandMessage);
setTimeout(() => {
  currentPanel?.webview.postMessage(rayResponseMessage);
}, 50);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Single postMessage call
currentPanel.webview.postMessage(rayResponseMessage);
```

### 2. Enhanced JavaScript Message Handling (`src/ui/assets/js/webview.js`)
- **Improved typing indicator management** - clears typing state when any response arrives
- **Better timeout handling** - clears timeout when response is received
- **Consistent message processing** - ensures only one message is displayed per response

## Key Changes

### Extension (`src/extension.ts`)
- Removed duplicate `addMessage` command format
- Kept single `rayResponse` format for consistency
- Eliminated unnecessary setTimeout delay

### Webview JavaScript (`src/ui/assets/js/webview.js`)
- Enhanced `handleIncomingMessage()` to clear typing indicator immediately
- Improved `addMessage()` to prevent duplicate typing states
- Better timeout management to prevent orphaned typing indicators

## Result
- âœ… **No more duplicate messages** - each Ray response appears only once
- âœ… **Proper typing indicator behavior** - shows while waiting, disappears when response arrives
- âœ… **Clean message flow** - consistent handling of all message types
- âœ… **Better user experience** - no confusion from duplicate content

## Testing
1. Build: `pnpm run compile`
2. Launch extension (F5)
3. Open RayDaemon panel
4. Send messages to Ray API
5. Verify each response appears only once

The chat interface now properly displays single responses from Ray without any duplication! ðŸŽ‰
