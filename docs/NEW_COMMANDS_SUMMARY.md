# New Commands Summary

This document summarizes the three new commands added to RayDaemon:

## 1. findByExtension

**Purpose**: Fast filtering of files by specific extensions with support for predefined extension groups.

**Key Features**:

- Single or multiple extension support
- Predefined extension groups (code, web, docs, config, images, media, data)
- Recursive search with depth control
- Hidden file inclusion option
- Case-sensitive matching option

**Usage**: `findByExtension <extensions|group> [directory] [--hidden|-a] [--case-sensitive|-c] [--depth|-d <number>]`

## 2. findSymbolsInFile

**Purpose**: Extract all top-level and nested symbols from a single file using VS Code's DocumentSymbol API.

**Key Features**:

- Leverages VS Code's native symbol providers
- Hierarchical symbol extraction (classes, methods, properties, etc.)
- Configurable nesting depth
- Symbol kind filtering
- Rich formatting with icons and location info

**Usage**: `findSymbolsInFile <filePath> [--no-children] [--depth|-d <number>] [--kind|-k <symbolKind>]`

## 3. findAllSymbols

**Purpose**: Walk the entire workspace and gather symbols from all matching files with incremental or full scan capabilities.

**Key Features**:

- Workspace-wide symbol analysis
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Incremental mode for better responsiveness
- File type filtering using extension groups
- Configurable output limits and formatting
- Error handling for files without symbol providers

**Usage**: `findAllSymbols [directory] [--extensions|-e <extensions>] [--no-children] [--depth|-d <number>] [--max-files <number>] [--max-show <number>] [--no-progress] [--incremental] [--flat] [--kind|-k <symbolKind>]`

## 4. searchSymbols (Bonus)

**Purpose**: Search for symbols by name across the workspace.

**Key Features**:

- Case-insensitive partial name matching
- Workspace-wide search
- Symbol kind filtering
- Location information with file paths and line numbers

**Usage**: `searchSymbols <query> [directory] [--extensions|-e <extensions>] [--no-children] [--no-progress] [--kind|-k <symbolKind>]`

## 5. findSymbol
**Purpose**: Locate a symbol by name across the workspace, return file + location.

**Key Features**:
- Uses VS Code's workspace symbol provider
- Case-sensitive and exact matching options
- Symbol kind filtering
- Configurable result limits
- Sorted by relevance (exact matches first)

**Usage**: `findSymbol <symbolName> [--case-sensitive|-c] [--exact|-e] [--max-results|-m <number>] [--kind|-k <symbolKind>]`

## 6. getSymbolReferences
**Purpose**: List all references to a given symbol.

**Key Features**:
- Reference lookup by file location or symbol name
- Context lines around references
- Include/exclude declaration option
- Grouped output by file
- Handles multiple symbol definitions

**Usage**: `getSymbolReferences <filePath> <line> <character> [options]` OR `getSymbolReferences --name <symbolName> [options]`

## 7. gotoSymbol
**Purpose**: Open a file and jump directly to a symbol definition.

**Key Features**:
- Navigation by coordinates or symbol name
- Multiple symbol handling with index selection
- File filtering for symbol search
- Focus preservation option
- Code context display

**Usage**: `gotoSymbol <filePath> <line> <character> [options]` OR `gotoSymbol --name <symbolName> [options]`

## 8. gotoDefinition (Bonus)
**Purpose**: Navigate to definition of symbol at current position.

**Key Features**:
- Follows VS Code's "Go to Definition" behavior
- Handles multiple definitions
- Source location tracking
- Focus preservation option

**Usage**: `gotoDefinition <filePath> <line> <character> [--preserve-focus]`

## Integration

All commands are:

- ✅ Fully integrated into the existing command system
- ✅ Follow the same error handling patterns
- ✅ Automatically appear in the help command
- ✅ Support the same extension group system
- ✅ Built with TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Include comprehensive documentation

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:

- `src/commands/commandMethods/fs/findByExtension.ts`
- `src/commands/commandMethods/fs/findSymbolsInFile.ts`
- `src/commands/commandMethods/fs/findAllSymbols.ts`
- `docs/FIND_BY_EXTENSION_COMMAND.md`
- `docs/SYMBOL_COMMANDS.md`
- `docs/NEW_COMMANDS_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files:

- `src/commands/commandMethods/fs/index.ts` - Added exports
- `src/commands/commandHandler.ts` - Added imports and command registrations

## Testing

The commands can be tested through:

1. VS Code extension development host
2. RayDaemon webview chat interface
3. Command palette integration

All commands build successfully with TypeScript strict mode and pass ESLint checks.

## Critical Bug Fix

Fixed a critical issue where the `findAllSymbols` and `searchSymbols` commands were passing extension group names (like "code") directly to `findByExtension` instead of expanding them to the actual extension arrays. This would have caused these commands to search for files with literal `.code` extensions instead of the intended programming language files.

**Solution**: Added an `expandExtensions()` helper function that properly expands extension groups before passing them to the underlying file search functions.
