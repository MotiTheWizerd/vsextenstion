# Tool UI Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the tool execution UI to provide a cleaner, more elegant user experience while maintaining full command results for Ray.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Clean Tool Status Messages
- **No Avatar**: Tool messages appear as system messages without Ray's avatar
- **One-Line Design**: Compact, elegant status indicators similar to modern IDEs
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between Ray's responses and tool execution

### 2. Three-State Tool Indicators

#### Working State
```
⚡ Reading file(s), Searching codebase [spinner]
```
- Shows active tool names
- Animated spinner indicates progress
- Blue color scheme

#### Success State
```
✅ Analyzed codebase                    46 results
```
- Clean completion message
- Result count on the right
- Green color scheme

#### Partial Success State
```
⚠️ Completed with 2 errors             4/6
```
- Shows error count
- Success/total ratio
- Yellow/orange color scheme

#### Failed State
```
❌ Tool execution failed
```
- Simple error indicator
- Red color scheme

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Extension Changes (`src/extension.ts`)
- Added `toolStatus` message type
- Shows working indicator before execution
- Sends completion status after execution
- Maintains full command results for Ray API

#### Webview JavaScript (`src/ui/assets/js/webview.js`)
- Added `handleToolStatus()` method
- Enhanced `addMessage()` with tool message support
- Automatic replacement of working indicators

#### CSS Styling (`src/ui/assets/css/webview.css`)
- Added `.tool-status` styles with different states
- Responsive design for mobile
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Modern color schemes matching VS Code theme

## Message Flow

1. **Ray sends command_calls** → Extension shows working indicator
2. **Commands execute** → Full results sent to Ray API
3. **Execution completes** → Clean status shown to user

## Benefits

- **User Experience**: Clean, non-intrusive tool indicators
- **Ray Integration**: Full command results still available to Ray
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches modern IDE design patterns
- **Performance**: Lightweight status messages vs. verbose command output

## Example Usage

When Ray uses tools like `searchRegex` or `findSymbol`, users will see:

1. `⚡ Searching codebase [spinner]` (while working)
2. `✅ Analyzed codebase    46 results` (when complete)

Instead of verbose command output that was previously shown.
