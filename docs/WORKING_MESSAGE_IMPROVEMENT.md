# Working Message Improvement

## Problem
When users send a message to Ray, they were seeing the raw status response `{status:"start working"}` instead of a user-friendly message indicating that Ray is processing their request.

## Solution
Implemented proper handling of Ray's "start working" status to show a user-friendly working message.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Ray Loop (`src/rayLoop.ts`)
- **Added status detection** for "start working" responses
- **Returns user-friendly message** instead of raw JSON
- **Handles multiple status formats** (`status: 'start working'`, `status: 'working'`, `message: 'start working'`)

```typescript
// Check if this is a "start working" status response
if (response.data?.status === 'start working' || 
    response.data?.status === 'working' ||
    response.data?.message === 'start working') {
  return 'ðŸ”„ **Ray is working on your request...** \n\nPlease wait while Ray processes your message. You\'ll receive the response shortly.';
}
```

### 2. Improved Extension Handler (`src/extension.ts`)
- **Detects status messages** in webhook responses
- **Sends working message** to webview immediately
- **Marks working messages** with `isWorking: true` flag

```typescript
// Check if this is a status message indicating Ray is starting to work
if (rayResponse.status === 'start working' || rayResponse.status === 'working') {
  const workingMessage = {
    type: 'rayResponse',
    data: {
      content: 'ðŸ”„ **Ray is working on your request...** \n\nPlease wait while Ray processes your message. You\'ll receive the response shortly.',
      isFinal: false,
      isWorking: true
    }
  };
  
  currentPanel.webview.postMessage(workingMessage);
  return;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Webview JavaScript (`src/ui/assets/js/webview.js`)
- **Handles working messages** with special `data-working` attribute
- **Replaces working messages** when final response arrives
- **Improved message flow** for better user experience

```javascript
// Mark working messages for easy identification
if (isWorking) {
  messageDiv.setAttribute('data-working', 'true');
}

// If this is a final response and we have a working message, replace it
if (isFinal !== false && !isWorking) {
  const workingMessage = this.chatMessages.querySelector('[data-working="true"]');
  if (workingMessage) {
    workingMessage.remove();
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before:
1. User sends message
2. User sees: `{status:"start working"}` (confusing raw JSON)
3. User waits without clear indication
4. Final response appears

### After:
1. User sends message
2. User sees: "ðŸ”„ **Ray is working on your request...** Please wait while Ray processes your message. You'll receive the response shortly."
3. Clear indication that Ray is processing
4. Working message is replaced with final response

## Benefits
- âœ… **User-friendly messaging** - No more raw JSON status responses
- âœ… **Clear feedback** - Users know Ray is working on their request
- âœ… **Professional appearance** - Proper loading states like modern chat interfaces
- âœ… **Seamless transitions** - Working message is replaced by actual response
- âœ… **Multiple status formats** - Handles various Ray API response formats

## Testing
1. Build: `pnpm run compile`
2. Launch extension (F5)
3. Open RayDaemon panel
4. Send a message to Ray API
5. Verify you see the working message instead of raw status JSON
6. Verify the working message is replaced when the final response arrives

The chat interface now provides clear, user-friendly feedback when Ray is processing requests! ðŸŽ‰
