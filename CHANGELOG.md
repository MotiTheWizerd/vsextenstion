## [1.2.2] - 2024-12-19 - Critical Race Condition Fix & Multi-Round Tool Execution

### Fixed

#### Critical Race Condition in Tool Execution
- **Multi-Round Execution Bug**: Fixed critical race condition where follow-up tool execution rounds would fail with "Tools already executing, skipping duplicate execution"
- **Infinite Loop Prevention**: Eliminated infinite loops where Ray would wait indefinitely for results that never came
- **Execution State Management**: Fixed `isExecutingTools` flag timing in `CommandExecutor` by resetting before sending results to Ray
- **Follow-up Command Processing**: Ray's follow-up responses with additional command calls now execute successfully

#### Tool Execution Flow Issues

- **Iterative Improvements**: Complete iterative workflows with multiple improvement rounds

### Performance Impact
- **Memory**: No impact - only affects control flow timing
- **Processing**: Minimal - slightly earlier flag reset improves flow
- **Network**: No additional API calls required
- **UI**: Positive - eliminates hanging states and shows proper progress for all rounds

## [1.2.1] - 2024-12-19 - Improved Command Grouping & Status Messages

### Fixed

#### Command Grouping Issues
- **Mixed Command Types**: Fixed issue where diagnostic analysis commands were being grouped with file modification commands
- **Duplicate Status Messages**: Eliminated duplicate completion messages for the same batch of operations
- **Inappropriate Grouping**: Commands are now properly categorized by their actual function rather than generic grouping

#### Status Message Accuracy
- **Diagnostic Commands**: Now properly identified and labeled as "Analyzed X diagnostics" instead of generic messages
- **File Modifications**: File write/append/replace operations get specific "Modified X files" messages
- **Search Operations**: Search commands get proper "Found X matches" or "Searched codebase" messages
- **Mixed Operations**: When multiple command types are executed, shows clear breakdown like "Analyzed 11 diagnostics + 2 file modifications"

### Added

#### Smart Command Categorization System
- **Command Categories**: Added 6 distinct categories (diagnostic, fileModification, fileReading, search, listing, indexing, other)
- **Category Detection**: Intelligent detection based on command names and patterns
- **Priority Handling**: Primary category determines the main message, with secondary categories noted
- **Flexible Messaging**: Different message formats for single-category vs mixed-category operations

#### Enhanced Message Generation
- **Category-Specific Messages**: Each command type gets appropriate completion messages
- **Result Analysis**: Messages include specific counts (diagnostics found, files modified, matches discovered)
- **Mixed Operation Support**: Clear indication when multiple types of operations are performed
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized message format across all command types

### Technical Changes

#### Message Handler (`src/ui/assets/js/webview/message-handler.js`)
- **New Functions**:
  - `categorizeCommands()`: Intelligently categorizes commands by type
  - `generateCategoryMessage()`: Creates appropriate messages based on command categories
  - `generateDiagnosticMessage()`: Specific messaging for diagnostic operations
  - `generateFileModificationMessage()`: Specific messaging for file modifications
  - `generateSearchMessage()`: Specific messaging for search operations
  - `generateMixedMessage()`: Handles multiple command types in one batch

#### Command Detection Logic
- **Diagnostic Commands**: `diagnostic`, `getalldiagnostics`, `getfilediagnostics`
- **File Modification**: `write`, `append`, `replace`
- **File Reading**: `read`, `open`
- **Search Commands**: `search`, `find` + `symbol`
- **Listing Commands**: `list`, `ls`
- **Indexing Commands**: `index`, `loadindex`, `createindex`

#### Improved Batch Description
- **Consistent Logic**: `getBatchDescription()` now uses the same categorization system
- **Better Starting Messages**: More accurate "Starting: X diagnostics + Y other operations" messages
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates generic messages when specific categories are available

### Improved

#### User Experience
- **Clearer Status Updates**: Users now see exactly what types of operations are being performed
- **Reduced Confusion**: No more misleading messages that group unrelated operations
- **Better Progress Tracking**: More informative progress messages during command execution
